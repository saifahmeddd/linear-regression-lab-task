# IMPLEMENTING A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL 
## INTRODCUTION
I implemented a simple linear regression model in my lab of machine learning.  
- to run the ipynb file, you need to run each cell block by block.
- the code requires installation of numpy, pandas, matplotlib(for graphical demonstration).

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.  
The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.  
The file **ex1data1.txt** (available under week 2's assignment material) contains the dataset for our linear regression exercise.  
The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city.  
A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
